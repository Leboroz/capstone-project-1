# Microverse Module 1 capstone project

> This is a website about a conference in Latin America.

I personalized the content of my page. I chose a conference for a Latin American congress.

## I used the following guidelines from the template.

- **Colors**. 
- **Typography**: COCOGOOSE and Lato as fonts, size and weight.
- **Layout**: composition and space between elements.
- The pages look almost identical to the original design.

## I built these 2 pages:

- The home page.
- The about page.

## Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes:

- **Mobile**: up to 768px wide.
- **Desktop**: 768px or wider.

## Interactions:

- The home page has a link in the menu to the about page.
- The logo in the header links to the home page.
- **Mobile menu**
   - When the user clicks the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
   - The mobile menu has a close (X) button that closes the menu.
- **Dynamic page**
   - The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
   - You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.
